   <div class="wrapper">
  <div class="one"><h1>One</h1>
  <p>This is One.  It often finds itself next to two.  Less often it will have zero on it's left.</p>
  
  <p>And "Why..." you ask, "does zero always have to appear on one's left?"  Well, that's not an easy question.  If you ponder that too long, some believe your brain will melt and run out your ears; or more likely... out your nose. I try not to think on it.</p>
  
  
  </div>
  <div class="two">
      <h1>Two</h1>
  <p>Two is not One.  Though it often finds itself next to one.  Two boasts that it is more than one.  Two insists that One take the lesser position.  Two is just that way.</p>
  
  <p>And "Why..." you ask, "does two always have to appear on one's right?"  Well, that's not an easy question.  If you ponder that too long, some believe your brain will melt and run out your ears; or more likely... out your nose. I try not to think on it.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="three"><h1>Three</h1>
   <p>Three is an odd one. Though its not really a one being a three.  It's just odd.  It has more going for it than two.  Its the bones of every trinity, but remains religiously uncommitted. Odd. </p>
  
  <p>Some will want to bring up threesomes. But I do not.  And isn't it your bed time?  Three more minutes.</p>
